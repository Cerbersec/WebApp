Once upon a time in a small city in Belgium, we were just snipping of our bear and dreaming about a lot of things. Until one of u said ‘Imagine we could take over the market of shoes and just develop a total e-commerce platform’. And yes, that was the moment that we started our journey. 
In a couple of months, we  just started from scratch and created a whole new web shop with over 1000 shoes and even relevant products such as socks, bels and soles. And of course, we are adding more products every day! 
At Brantayes, we will offer everyone, from 1 year until 101 year shoes, a shoe that he or she likes. You can just sing up on our website, receive our monthly newsletters with new promo’s, shoes and more, and together we will build up a beautiful online shoe shop!
Hit us up if you have any questions about it! We look forward to you see you as a customer at our web shop!
